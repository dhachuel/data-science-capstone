# Regular Expressions

-  Regular expression can be through of as combination of literals and meta-characters
-  To draw an analogy with natural language, think of literal text forming the words of this language, and the meta-characters defining its grammar
-  Regular expression have a rich set of meta-characters
-  Simplest pattern consists only of literals; a match occurs if the sequence of literals occurs anywhere in the text being tested
-  What if we only want the word "Obama"? or sentences that end in the word "Clinton", or "clinton" or "clinto"?
